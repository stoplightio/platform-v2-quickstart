# Stoplight Platform Overview
Stoplight is a collaborative API lifecycle platform equipping teams with tooling to build quality APIs faster. Teams can [Collaborate](#collaborate-with-workspaces), [Sync](#maintain-a-single-source-of-truth-with-projects), [Govern](#govern-with-explorer), [Design](#design-and-document-with-studio), [Document](#design-and-document-with-studio), [Mock](#develop-faster-with-hosted-mocks) and [Share](#share-with-hubs) APIs across their organization.

This overview will quickly walk you through the significant features and flows of the new Platform. 

## Collaborate with Workspaces
Bring all stakeholders together in one place with flexible permissions depending on the organization needs. 

- **Invite members** with different roles and privileges.
- **Whitelist domains** to quickly onboard team members.
- **Get feedback** from customers and partners with the guest access role.

## Maintain a single source of truth with Projects
Projects are the center of everything in Stoplight. Bring in existing projects or build new ones, and always keep them in sync with your Git Provider.  

- **Add projects from Git providers** like GitHub or Gitlab. 
- **Toggle project visibility** between private, internal, and public.
- **Keep projects and their documentation in sync** with your VCS without introducing any additional steps. Edit, Save, Push. Just like developers are used to.

## Govern with Explorer
Explorer is a central repository for all design assets across the organization that serves as a source of truth for stakeholders in different parts of the API lifecycle. Stoplight Explorer makes it easy to find, search, and manage API artifacts.

- **Find obscure APIs** easily with filters and a powerful search.
- **Visualize inbound and outbound dependencies** for API artifacts.
- **Track changes** between versions.
- **Encourage reuse** across the organization.
- **Promote consistency** across APIs.
- **Provide interactive documentation**.
- Share with consumers, and **get early feedback**.

## Design and Document with Studio
Studio is a visual editor for documentation and design with a new and improved UI/UX, helping build quality designs and documentation quickly. 

- **Push local projects to Git from within Studio** and make them available to team members.

## Develop faster with Hosted Mocks
An up-to-date mock server is readily available for all APIs.

- **Get feedback from stakeholders** on API designs without putting any effort into the development.
- Enable Frontend and Backend teams to **develop in parallel**.

## Share with Hubs
Create a Hub to publish documentation for multiple projects that are always in sync with your workspace.

- **Create navigations** without changing project structure using filters.
- **Set up custom domains and SSL**.
