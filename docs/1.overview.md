## Maintain a single source of truth with Projects
Projects are the center stage of everything you do in Stoplight. Bring in your existing projects or build new ones, and always keep them in sync with your Git Provider.  
- Add your projects from your Git provider like GitHub or Gitlab. It's as easy as putting in your username and password.
- Toggle project visibility between private, internal, and public.
- Keep projects and their documentation in sync with your Git Repo without introducing any additional steps. Edit, Save, Push. Just like your developers are used to.
