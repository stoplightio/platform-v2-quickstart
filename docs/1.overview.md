## Maintain a single source of truth with Projects
Projects are the center stage of everything you do in Stoplight. Bring in your existing projects or build new ones, and always keep them in sync with your Git Provider.  
- **Add projects from Git providers** like GitHub or Gitlab. 
- **Toggle project visibility** between private, internal, and public.
- **Keep projects and their documentation in sync** with your VCS without introducing any additional steps. Edit, Save, Push. Just like your developers are used to.
