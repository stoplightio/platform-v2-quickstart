# Limitations and Issues

## Planned Features
- **More Git Providers** - Support for Bitbucket and Azure DevOps.
- **Support for SAML and LDAP** - Support for GitHub SSO is already available. 
- **Design Library** - Create a collection of reusable models.
- **Tags in Explorer** - Filter granularly with tags in Explorer.
- **Themes for Hubs** - Brand your public documentation according to your Organization theme. 
- **Try it out** functionality in Studio - Try it out is already available in Explorer and Hubs. 
- **Images in Documentation for Private Repositories** - Images in private repositories do not render in the documentation. As a workaround, you can publish them and add a link in docs.  
## Known Bugs

- `Go to ref` in dependencies explorer doesn't take the user to the referenced model.
